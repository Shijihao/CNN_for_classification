this film puts wang at the forefront of china 's sixth generation of film makers . 
broomfield is energized by volletta wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality 
we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
the very definition of the 'small ' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
despite its raucous intent , xxx is as conventional as a nike ad and as rebellious as spring break . 
a real clunker . a well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless . 
a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society . 
it 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
the story 's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it 's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments . 
as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing .

i 'm sure if you 're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i did n't care for it . 
like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .

occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too . 
more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
[ grant ] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it .

white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that does n't mean you wo n't like looking at it . 
this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there 's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it 's not a motion picture ; it 's an utterly static picture .

a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama .

both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny .

velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film '' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
a very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
the humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
it 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish was n't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
several of steven soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .

with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [ crane ] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
it 's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .

while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
sure , it 's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it 's never as solid as you want it to be . 
obvious 
not for the prurient or squeamish , it 's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
