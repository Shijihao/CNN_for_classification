1	the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
1	audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit .

0	perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
0	velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
1	candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
0	a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
0	the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
0	a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
1	the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
0	it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
1	a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
0	several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
0	by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
1	a moving and important film . 
0	much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
0	with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
1	it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
1	using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .

1	i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
0	while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
0	stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
1	after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
1	sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
0	obvious
1	not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics .

1	the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .
